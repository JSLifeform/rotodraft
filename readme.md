**README**

This is the humble beginnings of a Rotisserie Draft application for Magic: The Gathering. If you are unfamiliar with what that is, just think of it as a fantasy football draft, but with Magic cards instead of players. The goal is to draft Magic cards in a snake draft format. A snake draft format is one where the draft order inverts every round. For example, the player with the first pick of the first round will have the last pick of the second round.

*How To Use*

When you load the page, it will ask for the number of drafters, followed by the number of rounds. Once these values are entered, a table is created for the draft. An input box in the top right corner allows the user to enter the card name and submit it to the table. There is currently no way to undo picks; this functionality may be added in future changes.

*Mobile Layout Changes*

As of version 0.1, the only changes made to smaller screens is the removal of the title banner and a maximum width set on table cell sizes. This is made easily apparent by creating a draft with 20+ drafters and varying the browser size.
